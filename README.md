# Mine - WIP

If you save a lot of posts or comments on reddit you know it's not easy to find the old ones.  Your only option is to scroll endlessly until you find what you're looking for.

This is a basic website that connects to your reddit account and loads all of your saved posts and comments.  It enables you to filter by type(post or comment) or search the contents of titles and comment bodies. All doable in realtime thanks to Phoenix LiveView. 

**Credit for the idea:**
This project was orginally inspired by this post on reddit: [Made an app, lets you find...](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/cs0qdx/made_an_app_lets_you_find_all_your_reddit_saves/).
It solves a really annoying problem, and I thought it would be a great exercise to get more familiar with LiveView and Elixir/Phoenix in general.
